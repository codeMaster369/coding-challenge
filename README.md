# My Java Project

This repository contains a Java project developed as part of the APT2080 course in Spring 2025 at USIU.

## Project Description

This project implements a set of Java classes demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and array manipulation. It includes examples of increment/decrement operators, temperature conversion, random number generation, conditional logic, and array operations.


## Challenges Solved

This project addresses the following coding challenges:

1.  **Increment and Decrement:** Demonstrates various increment and decrement operators.
2.  **Increment and Decrement Order:** Explains the difference between pre- and post-increment/decrement.
3.  **Converting to Celsius:** Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and rounds the result.
4.  **Overriding (Random):** Generates random numbers using the `Random` class.
5.  **Dice Decision (if-else):** Simulates dice rolls and determines a win condition.
6.  **Exercise: If-Else Decision (Subscription):** Provides subscription discounts based on expiration.
7.  **Array Challenge (Filtering):** Filters array elements based on a condition.
8.  **Array Challenge (Random Order IDs):** Generates random order IDs.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed.
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** You can use NetBeans or any other Java IDE.
